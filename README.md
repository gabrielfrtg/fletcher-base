# Fletcher Base: A Foundational Implementation

This repository contains a clean and minimal base implementation of the Fletcher project, designed to be a stable starting point for developing new, specialized versions.

## About This Project

Fletcher Base was created by carefully refactoring the original [`fletcher-io` repository](https://github.com/gabrielfrtg/fletcher-io). It contains only the core algorithm and essential scripts, with all specific hardware optimizations (like advanced I/O or parallelism) removed.

The primary goal is to provide a clean slate for developers and researchers who wish to build and test their own Fletcher implementations targeting different architectures like OpenCL, CUDA, or FPGAs.
